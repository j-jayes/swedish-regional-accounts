# Swedish regional accounts

## Purpose

To create a dashboard to visualize the regional accounts data in Sweden collected as part of Kerstin's project.

## Process

I want to ingest the data and create some charts and maps. 

In addition, I want to create a script that collects the data from 2012 onwards for regional GDP at kommun level and aggregates it to l√§n level in line with the historical data.

I want to practice using the `ggiraph` package.

## Progress

I've ingested the data from 1750 to 1850, made some exploratory plots and put them up in a flex dashboard.

A beta is available on my [Shinyapps page](https://jonathan-jayes.shinyapps.io/swedish-regional-accounts/).
